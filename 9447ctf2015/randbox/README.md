# randbox

There was a series of 10 ciphers, which had to be broken with 21 queries.
Some were just substitution, some were symmetric, some were CBC-like
(using an IV and addition or xor to encrypt subsequent bytes), and the last one
also swapped pairs of bytes. (You can look at [randbox.py](randbox.py) for
details. [warning: ctf quality code])
